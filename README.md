# Glyphsmith: Fall-season Math Ritual

Glyphsmith is a browser-based, math-driven arcade experience. Speak in numbers and operators to cast spells that collapse into the exact target value, while steadying a sequence of increasingly unstable encounters. Build streaks, honor sigil conditions for heavy bonuses, and feel the pressure as the clock shrinks.

## Play the game

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Tap **Start Casting** to begin the ritual.
3. Use the on-screen glyph keyboard (or your physical keyboard) to compose an expression that evaluates exactly to the target number.
4. Honor the highlighted **Sigil Condition** for each challenge to earn a surge of essence and deal heavy stability damage.
5. Hit **Cast** or press Enter to submit.
6. Use every digit in the glyph bank to trigger combo multipliers. Longer, more complex expressions also boost rewards.
7. Each successful cast weakens the current encounter and raises your level, squeezing the timer. Miss or mistype and your streak collapses.
8. Spend artifacts — **Stabilize Flow** to reclaim time and **Reforge Glyphs** to redraw a challenge — when the rift rewards them.

The layout is responsive and the primary workspace maintains a minimum 50% of the viewport height, keeping the play area visible even when mobile keyboards claim half the screen.

## Features

- **Stage-based encounters** – Stabilize escalating foes, each with distinct lore, scaling health, and artifact rewards.
- **Dynamic sigil conditions** – Optional objectives such as using parentheses, subtraction, or power glyphs that grant bonus essence and extra damage when satisfied.
- **Artifacts** – Earn and deploy Stabilize Flow (adds breathing room to the timer) and Reforge Glyphs (refreshes the current challenge without penalty).
- **Procedural spellcraft** – Each round rolls a fresh glyph bank and target, with adaptive difficulty tied to your level and stage.
- **Spell chronicle** – A running log of successes, miscasts, timeouts, and encounter events to study your ritual history.
- **Glyph awareness** – Digits highlight as they are used, encouraging clever reuse of the available symbols.
- **Adaptive timer & combo scoring** – Complex expressions and complete glyph usage amplify rewards as the window to respond narrows.
- **Keyboard & touch support** – Tap the glyph keyboard or type directly.

## Tech stack

- Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Responsive layout tailored for desktop and mobile play.
